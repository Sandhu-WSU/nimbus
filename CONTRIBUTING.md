## Resolve an issue

Pull request are welcome. If you want to contribute code to solve an issue:

* Add a comment to tell everyone you are working on the issue.
* If an issue has someone assigned it means that person is already working on it.
* Fork the project.
* Create a topic branch based on master.
* Commit there your code to solve the issue.
* Make sure all test are passing (and add specs to test any new feature if needed).
* Follow these [best practices](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
* Open a *pull request* to the main repository describing what issue you are addressing.

## Cleaning up

In the rush of time sometimes things get messy, you can help us cleaning things up:

* implementing pending specs
* increasing code coverage
* improving code quality
* updating dependencies
* making code consistent

## Other ways of contributing without coding

* If you think there's a feature missing, or find a bug, create an issue (make sure it has not already been reported).
* You can also help promoting the project talking about it in your social networks.

## How to report an issue

* Try to use a descriptive and to-the-point title
* Is a good idea to include some of there sections:
  * Steps to reproduce the bug
  * Expected behaviour/response
  * Actual response
* Sometimes it is also helpful if you mention your operating system or shell.
